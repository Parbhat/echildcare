# e-vaccination

## About

In India currently only a few percentage of population use Internet. The
maximum percentage of population has access to SMS. With this project we are trying to
solve problems at the grass root level. This SMS application works similar to a web or mobile
application. The users can register with the service only with a simple SMS. Now they will
get SMS/E-mail notification about the vaccination date and place for their child. The
Government can also use the application to inform its citizens about its policies,
development, medicines in case of new diseases. We will also create a web application for
the population who use Internet. The Web application describes the whole process in detail.
Hospitals can also register the new born child details on the website. Now parents will get
all the government vaccination and medicines schemes for their child. The scope of this
project is not restricted to this. Once completed, it can be used in any sector to attract a
large percentage of population.
